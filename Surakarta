For both sides of the game, each is seeking a move that is beneficial to them. This reciprocating alternate is the min-max search. The final estimate of the current situation is
finally obtained.As the depth of search increases, the situation that needs to be searched increases exponentially. Reasonable use of the minimum-maximum search can be evolved into Alpha-Beta pruning searchSo, in a limited
amount of time, the number of layers in a computer search is very shallow.

And to find a better way for the computer,the number of layers searched should be as deep as possible.
Therefore, in the search process, you should stop expanding the child nodes that are no longer necessary to expand, which is equivalent to cutting off some of 
the branches on the gametree. Based on this, the search algorithm such as PVS and MTD search can be used for pruning. For different types of chess, the difference 
in pruning algorithms may also result in different chess forces in the computer game system. 
This requires the designer to be familiar with the target chess and different pruning algorithms, and adopt the corresponding algorithm according to the rules of the target chess.
Therefore, it is difficult to make a general search optimization algorithm that adapts to various types quickly and well on this basis.
